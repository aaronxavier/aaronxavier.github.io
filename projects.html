                <h3>An Evaluative Study of Spatial Map Building Algorithms (Academic)</h3>
                <p>Studies the possibility of using RTAB-Map for a 3D mapping and reconstruction pipeline which can
                    further be integrated into robotic systems for various applications. Benchmarking the system on an
                    NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and ZED2 and implemented it on the laboratory UAV.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>A Systems-based design of a Truck Platooning System</h3>
                <p>Designed and developed a systems engineering model of a complex truck platooning system. Carried out
                    the complete design process from requirement gathering, component and architecture design until
                    system testing. Used SysML for the modelling tasks and eventually built the system using C++ (for
                    multithreading) and Python for the application development.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Factory Inspection using 3D Computer Vision (Academic)</h3>
                <p>Developed an SfM-based pipeline to build a 3D model of the region of interest which could be then
                    used by maintenance staff to perform inspection remotely. The system was built and deployed using
                    ROS on a Jetson Nano, the images being streamed to a local PC and run through OpenSfM to generate a
                    3D point cloud of the scene.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Object Detection and Localization using Stereo Vision</h3>
                <p>Developed a vision pipeline in MATLAB for object detection for a mobile ground robot using the ZED
                    Mini. The system was able to generate a point cloud of the scene and extract the relevant object
                    using color segmentation. The depth to the object was estimated and the 3D coordinates of the object
                    were published onto the ROS network.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Multi-Agent Path Planning (in Simulation)</h3>
                <p>Designed a waypoint-based path planning scheme in Python for a simulated work area with 3 agents
                    working simultaneously to achieve a goal. Implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm for individual robots and
                    implemented a rudimentary form of Travelling Salesman Problem to optimize traversed routes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Path and Task planning of an Autonomous Rover using Markers</h3>
                <p>An autonomous robot capable of planning a path and navigating to the given target(s) while avoiding
                    the obstacles in its path was developed. The system was based on an ESP32 platform and communicated
                    with the localization setup on a local computer via AWS IoT. The firmware was written in C++ and
                    used PlatformIO for interfacing with the microcontroller. The local computer used OpenCV for image
                    processing and ARuco markers for border geometry estimation and rover localization.</p>
